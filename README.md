# lockbook-x

Collection of [Lockbook](https://github.com/lockbook/lockbook) extensions and
experiments. Projects such as `c_interface_v2` and `go-lockbook` have the hope
of being merged into the official Lockbook repository one day. Other ones such
as `lbcli` (and other Go projects) will likely live here forever.

## Projects

* [`c_interface_v2`](./c_interface_v2) - C FFI (in Rust) for [`lockook_core`](https://github.com/lockbook/lockbook/tree/master/libs/core).
* [`go-lockbook`](./go-lockbook) - Go bindings for Lockbook core using `c_interface_v2`.
* [`lbcli`](./lbcli) - A CLI written in Go using the Go bindings.
